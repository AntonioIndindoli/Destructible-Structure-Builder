# Destructible Structure Builder

Destructible Structure Builder is a toolkit for Unity that lets you create walls and structural members that react to damage and crumble apart at runtime. It includes editor helpers for rapidly assembling buildings, a physics-based destruction framework and a library of demo materials, sounds and particle effects.

*Compatible with Unity 2021.3 LTS â€“ 2022.3*

## Key Features

- Voxel-based beams and wall pieces with per-cell health
- Automatic stress simulation and collapse behaviour
- Event hooks for custom effects (`onDestroyed`, `onCrumble`, etc.)
- Sample scene and URP-ready materials

See the full [Manual](Documentation/Manual.md) for setup and usage instructions.
